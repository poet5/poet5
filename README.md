### Hey! My name is Sahil Kajuri, also known on the Internet as Poet5.

### You may know me from my life, or online in various Discords, most frequently online on the Digital Devil Saga Discord.

###  

I am working as an aspiring Network Engineer, and I program especially in C/C++.

You can ask me about making a network application, and I accept DM's for requests on my Discord Account.

(My DM's are at the very bottom, so you can just scroll down on there.).



### What I'm doing currently.

- I am doing OpenGL and working in the Voxel Engine, although I'm starting a few days ago, or months depending on how long I don't keep this updated, and when you see this MD file.
- I am trying to make my own Traffic Generator and Checksum as an experiment.
- As well as my own protocol.
- Updates are slow, but I will make it public,  someday ;)
